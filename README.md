# DICOM Viewer

A simple DICOM viewer application built with Electron.js and Cornerstone.js libraries. This viewer allows you to load and view DICOM images with various tools for image manipulation and measurement.

## Features

- Load single DICOM files or entire series
- Basic image manipulation (Window/Level, Pan, Zoom)
- Measurement tools (Length, Angle, Rectangle ROI, Elliptical ROI)
- Annotation tools (Arrow)
- Series navigation
- 80/20 split layout (viewer/controls)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
